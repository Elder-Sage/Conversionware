Conversionware
============================

Small program designed to convert a number in either binary, base 10, octal, or hexadecimal into any other type of number.
Example being binary into decimal, decimal into Octal, or decimal to binary. This will be a step by step process to implement every kind of conversion combination.

v0.2 Adding the ability to prompt user if they would like to run the program again after it has converted 
their first input value.

v0.3.1 Added better switch case for choice in what to convert. Added more choices in the different kinds of conversion that a user can choose. Converted function to calculate the conversions.

v0.3.2 With all the upgrades to the program to include converions into Octal and Hexadecimal the named had to be changed to something that was closer to being the truth. In this update the conversions into octal and hexadecimal from binary or decimal have been fully implemented and working correctly. The next step will be to update and be able to convert from octal or hexadecimal into the others.
